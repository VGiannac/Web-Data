## Web Data Extraction and Modification with Python

### Overview:

  In data science and analytics, operations like web data extraction and manipulation are crucial. This project uses Python to investigate three main areas: online scraping, API interaction, and XML parsing. Every task adds to a modular package in Python, which makes it possible to combine explanations and code in an easy-to-use manner.
  
### Tools and Technologies:
- Python 3.11.6
- Requests 2.31
- BeautifulSoup 4.12.2
- xml.etree.ElementTree (for XML parsing)
- Pandas 2.1.1
- Matplotlib 3.8.0
- Seaborn 0.13.0
- WordCloud 1.9.2

### XML Parsing

  In the XML parsing section, we delve into Apple's robots.txt file to explore the structure of their website. By extracting information from XML sitemaps, we use Python to traverse HTML structures and transform unprocessed data into clean Pandas DataFrames.

```python
# Example XML Parsing Code
from src.web_data.xml_parser import XmlParser

website_robots_url = "https://www.apple.com/robots.txt"
xml_parser = XmlParser(website_robots_url)

# Extract and print sitemap URLs
sitemap_urls = xml_parser.get_sitemap_urls()
print("Sitemap URLs:", sitemap_urls)

# Transform sitemap data into a DataFrame
sitemap_df = xml_parser.get_sitemap_data()
print(sitemap_df)

### Applying an API

  We enable the Open Trivia Database API under the API section to collect difficult questions and answers. Using this plethora of information, our Python class ApiHandler transforms raw data into a clean DataFrame suitable for insightful analysis.

## Getting Started
  To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Explore the provided scripts in the src/web_data directory for XML parsing, API handling, and more.
